    "## 1.1 Introduction to OpenCV-Python Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenCV\n",
    "OpenCV was started at Intel in 1999 by **Gary Bradsky**, and the first release came out in 2000. **Vadim Pisarevsky** joined Gary Bradsky to manage Intel's Russian software OpenCV team. In 2005, OpenCV was used on Stanley, the vehicle that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Later, its active development continued under the support of Willow Garage with Gary Bradsky and Vadim Pisarevsky leading the project. OpenCV now supports a multitude of algorithms related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning and is expanding day by day.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, etc., and is available on different platforms including Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, and iOS. Interfaces for high-speed GPU operations based on CUDA and OpenCL are also under active development.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV-Python is the Python API for OpenCV, combining the best qualities of the OpenCV C++ API and the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenCV-Python\n",
    "OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general purpose programming language started by **Guido van Rossum** that became very popular very quickly, mainly because of its simplicity and code readability. It enables the programmer to express ideas in fewer lines of code without reducing readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to languages like C/C++, Python is slower. That said, Python can be easily extended with C/C++, which allows us to write computationally intensive code in C/C++ and create Python wrappers that can be used as Python modules. This gives us two advantages: first, the code is as fast as the original C/C++ code (since it is the actual C++ code working in background) and second, it easier to code in Python than C/C++. OpenCV-Python is a Python wrapper for the original OpenCV C++ implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV-Python makes use of **Numpy**, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenCV-Python Tutorials\n",
    "OpenCV introduces a new set of tutorials which will guide you through various functions available in OpenCV-Python. **This guide is mainly focused on OpenCV 3.x version** (although most of the tutorials will also work with OpenCV 2.x).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior knowledge of Python and Numpy is recommended as they won't be covered in this guide. **Proficiency with Numpy is a must in order to write optimized code using OpenCV-Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial was originally started by Abid Rahman K. as part of the Google Summer of Code 2013 program under the guidance of Alexander Mordvintsev.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenCV Needs You !!!\n",
    "Since OpenCV is an open source initiative, all are welcome to make contributions to the library, documentation, and tutorials. If you find any mistake in this tutorial (from a small spelling mistake to an egregious error in code or concept), feel free to correct it by cloning OpenCV in [GitHub](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and submitting a pull request. OpenCV developers will check your pull request, give you important feedback and (once it passes the approval of the reviewer) it will be merged into OpenCV. You will then become an open source contributor :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "As new modules are added to OpenCV-Python, this tutorial will have to be expanded. If you are familiar with a particular algorithm and can write up a tutorial including basic theory of the algorithm and code showing example usage, please do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, we together can make this project a great success !!!\n",
    "\n",

    "## 1.3 Install OpenCV-Python in Ubuntu\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "In this tutorial We will learn to setup OpenCV-Python in Ubuntu System. Below steps are tested for Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 (both 64-bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV-Python can be installed in Ubuntu in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install from pre-built binaries available in Ubuntu repositories\n",
    "- Compile from the source. In this section, we will see both.\n",
    "Another important thing is the additional libraries required. OpenCV-Python requires only **Numpy** (in addition to other dependencies, which we will see later). But in this tutorials, we also use **Matplotlib** for some easy and nice plotting purposes (which I feel much better compared to OpenCV). Matplotlib is optional, but highly recommended. Similarly we will also see **IPython**, an Interactive Python Terminal, which is also highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing OpenCV-Python from Pre-built Binaries\n",
    "This method serves best when using just for programming and developing OpenCV applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install package [python3-opencv](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/python3-opencv) with following command in terminal (as root user).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python3-opencv\n",
    "```\n",
    "Open Python IDLE (or IPython) and type following codes in Python terminal.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cv2 as cv\n",
    "print(cv.__version__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the results are printed out without any errors, congratulations !!! You have installed OpenCV-Python successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite easy. But there is a problem with this. Apt repositories may not contain the latest version of OpenCV always. For example, at the time of writing this tutorial, apt repository contains 2.4.8 while latest OpenCV version is 3.x. With respect to Python API, latest version will always contain much better support and latest bug fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for getting latest source codes preference is next method, i.e. compiling from source. Also at some point in time, if you want to contribute to OpenCV, you will need this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building OpenCV from source\n",
    "Compiling from source may seem a little complicated at first, but once you succeeded in it, there is nothing complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will install some dependencies. Some are required, some are optional. You can skip optional dependencies if you don't want.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required build dependencies\n",
    "We need **CMake** to configure the installation, **GCC** for compilation, **Python-devel** and **Numpy** for building Python bindings etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install cmake\n",
    "sudo apt-get install gcc g++\n",
    "```\n",
    "to support python2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "to support python3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next we need **GTK** support for GUI features, Camera support (v4l), Media Support (ffmpeg, gstreamer) etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "to support gtk2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "to support gtk3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Dependencies\n",
    "Above dependencies are sufficient to install OpenCV in your Ubuntu machine. But depending upon your requirements, you may need some extra dependencies. A list of such optional dependencies are given below. You can either leave it or install it, your call :)\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV comes with supporting files for image formats like PNG, JPEG, JPEG2000, TIFF, WebP etc. But it may be a little old. If you want to get latest libraries, you can install development files for system libraries of these formats.\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libpng-dev\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libopenexr-dev\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libtiff-dev\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libwebp-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "> **Note** \n",
    "If you are using Ubuntu 16.04 you can also install `libjasper-dev` to add a system level support for the JPEG2000 format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading OpenCV\n",
    "To download the latest source from OpenCV's GitHub Repository. (If you want to contribute to OpenCV choose this. For that, you need to install **Git** first)\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install git\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "It will create a folder \"opencv\" in current directory. The cloning may take some time depending upon your internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open a terminal window and navigate to the downloaded \"opencv\" folder. Create a new \"build\" folder and navigate to it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir build\n",
    "cd build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring and Installing\n",
    "Now we have all the required dependencies, let's install OpenCV. Installation has to be configured with CMake. It specifies which modules are to be installed, installation path, which additional libraries to be used, whether documentation and examples to be compiled etc. Most of this work are done automatically with well configured default parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below command is normally used for configuration of OpenCV library build (executed from build folder):\n",
    "```\n",
    "cmake ../\n",
    "```\n",
    "OpenCV defaults assume \"Release\" build type and installation path is \"/usr/local\". For additional information about CMake options refer to OpenCV [**C++ compilation guide**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see these lines in your CMake output (they mean that Python is properly found):\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3.1 Basic Operations on Images\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access pixel values and modify them\n",
    "- Access image properties\n",
    "- Set a Region of Interest (ROI)\n",
    "- Split and merge images\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all the operations in this section are mainly related to Numpy rather than OpenCV. A good knowledge of Numpy is required to write better optimized code with OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "*( Examples will be shown in a Python terminal, since most of them are just single lines of code )*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing and Modifying pixel values\n",
    "Let's load a color image first:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> import cv2 as cv\n",
    ">>> img = cv.imread('messi5.jpg')\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can access a pixel value by its row and column coordinates. For BGR image, it returns an array of Blue, Green, Red values. For grayscale image, just corresponding intensity is returned.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> px = img[100,100]\n",
    ">>> print( px )\n",
    "[157 166 200]\n",
    "# accessing only blue pixel\n",
    ">>> blue = img[100,100,0]\n",
    ">>> print( blue )\n",
    "157\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can modify the pixel values the same way.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> img[100,100] = [255,255,255]\n",
    ">>> print( img[100,100] )\n",
    "[255 255 255]\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is an optimized library for fast array calculations. So simply accessing each and every pixel value and modifying it will be very slow and it is discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "The above method is normally used for selecting a region of an array, say the first 5 rows and last 3 columns. For individual pixel access, the Numpy array methods, array.item() and array.itemset() are considered better. They always return a scalar, however, so if you want to access all the B,G,R values, you will need to call array.item() separately for each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better pixel accessing and editing method :\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# accessing RED value\n",
    ">>> img.item(10,10,2)\n",
    "59\n",
    "# modifying RED value\n",
    ">>> img.itemset((10,10,2),100)\n",
    ">>> img.item(10,10,2)\n",
    "100\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Accessing Image Properties\n",
    "Image properties include number of rows, columns, and channels; type of image data; number of pixels; etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of an image is accessed by img.shape. It returns a tuple of the number of rows, columns, and channels (if the image is color):\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print( img.shape )\n",
    "(342, 548, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "If an image is grayscale, the tuple returned contains only the number of rows and columns, so it is a good method to check whether the loaded image is grayscale or color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total number of pixels is accessed by `img.size`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print( img.size )\n",
    "562248\n",
    "```\n",
    "Image datatype is obtained by `img.dtype`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print( img.dtype )\n",
    "uint8\n",
    "```\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "`img.dtype` is very important while debugging because a large number of errors in OpenCV-Python code are caused by invalid datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image ROI\n",
    "Sometimes, you will have to play with certain regions of images. For eye detection in images, first face detection is done over the entire image. When a face is obtained, we select the face region alone and search for eyes inside it instead of searching the whole image. It improves accuracy (because eyes are always on faces :D ) and performance (because we search in a small area).\n",
    "\n",
    "ROI is again obtained using Numpy indexing. Here I am selecting the ball and copying it to another region in the image:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ball = img[280:340, 330:390]\n",
    ">>> img[273:333, 100:160] = ball\n",
    "```\n",
    "Check the results below:\n",
    "![roi](./images/roi.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting and Merging Image Channels\n",
    "Sometimes you will need to work separately on the B,G,R channels of an image. In this case, you need to split the BGR image into single channels. In other cases, you may need to join these individual channels to create a BGR image. You can do this simply by:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> b,g,r = cv.split(img)\n",
    ">>> img = cv.merge((b,g,r))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> b = img[:,:,0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Suppose you want to set all the red pixels to zero - you do not need to split the channels first. Numpy indexing is faster:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> img[:,:,2] = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "[**cv.split()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/de8/group__core__array.html#ga0547c7fed86152d7e9d0096029c8518a) is a costly operation (in terms of time). So use it only if necessary. Otherwise go for Numpy indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Borders for Images (Padding)\n",
    "If you want to create a border around an image, something like a photo frame, you can use [**cv.copyMakeBorder()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/de8/group__core__array.html#ga2ac1049c2c3dd25c2b41bffe17658a36).

    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "- Learn several arithmetic operations on images, like addition, subtraction, bitwise operations, and etc.\n",
    "- Learn these functions: [**cv.add()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/de8/group__core__array.html#ga10ac1bfb180e2cfda1701d06c24fdbd6), [**cv.addWeighted()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/de8/group__core__array.html#gafafb2513349db3bcff51f54ee5592a19), etc.\n",

    "You can add two images with the OpenCV function, [**cv.add()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/de8/group__core__array.html#ga10ac1bfb180e2cfda1701d06c24fdbd6), or simply by the numpy operation res = img1 + img2. Both images should be of same depth and type, or the second image can just be a scalar value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "There is a difference between OpenCV addition and Numpy addition. OpenCV addition is a saturated operation while Numpy addition is a modulo operation.\n",

    "## 3.3 Performance Measurement and Improvement Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "In image processing, since you are dealing with a large number of operations per second, it is mandatory that your code is not only providing the correct solution, but that it is also providing it in the fastest manner. So in this chapter, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To measure the performance of your code.\n",
    "- Some tips to improve the performance of your code.\n",
    "- You will see these functions: [**cv.getTickCount**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/de0/group__core__utils.html#gae73f58000611a1af25dd36d496bf4487), [**cv.getTickFrequency**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/de0/group__core__utils.html#ga705441a9ef01f47acdc55d87fbe5090c), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from OpenCV, Python also provides a module **time** which is helpful in measuring the time of execution. Another module **profile** helps to get a detailed report on the code, like how much time each function in the code took, how many times the function was called, etc. But, if you are using IPython, all these features are integrated in an user-friendly manner. We will see some important ones, and for more details, check links in the **Additional Resources** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Performance with OpenCV\n",
    "The [**cv.getTickCount**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/de0/group__core__utils.html#gae73f58000611a1af25dd36d496bf4487) function returns the number of clock-cycles after a reference event (like the moment the machine was switched ON) to the moment this function is called. So if you call it before and after the function execution, you get the number of clock-cycles used to execute a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**cv.getTickFrequency**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/de0/group__core__utils.html#ga705441a9ef01f47acdc55d87fbe5090c) function returns the frequency of clock-cycles, or the number of clock-cycles per second. So to find the time of execution in seconds, you can do following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "e1 = cv.getTickCount()\n",
    "# your code execution\n",
    "e2 = cv.getTickCount()\n",
    "time = (e2 - e1)/ cv.getTickFrequency()\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will demonstrate with following example. The following example applies median filtering with kernels of odd sizes ranging from 5 to 49. (Don't worry about what the result will look like - that is not our goal):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "img1 = cv.imread('messi5.jpg')\n",
    "e1 = cv.getTickCount()\n",
    "for i in range(5,49,2):\n",
    "    img1 = cv.medianBlur(img1,i)\n",
    "e2 = cv.getTickCount()\n",
    "t = (e2 - e1)/cv.getTickFrequency()\n",
    "print( t )\n",
    "# Result I got is 0.521107655 seconds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "You can do the same thing with the time module. Instead of cv.getTickCount, use the time.time() function. Then take the difference of the two times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Optimization in OpenCV\n",
    "Many of the OpenCV functions are optimized using SSE2, AVX, etc. It contains the unoptimized code also. So if our system support these features, we should exploit them (almost all modern day processors support them). It is enabled by default while compiling. So OpenCV runs the optimized code if it is enabled, otherwise it runs the unoptimized code. You can use [**cv.useOptimized()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/de0/group__core__utils.html#gafa6d5d04eff341825573ec6c0aa6519f) to check if it is enabled/disabled and [**cv.setUseOptimized()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/de0/group__core__utils.html#ga3c8487ea4449e550bc39575ede094c7a) to enable/disable it. Let's see a simple example.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# check if optimization is enabled\n",
    "In [5]: cv.useOptimized()\n",
    "Out[5]: True\n",
    "In [6]: %timeit res = cv.medianBlur(img,49)\n",
    "10 loops, best of 3: 34.9 ms per loop\n",
    "# Disable it\n",
    "In [7]: cv.setUseOptimized(False)\n",
    "In [8]: cv.useOptimized()\n",
    "Out[8]: False\n",
    "In [9]: %timeit res = cv.medianBlur(img,49)\n",
    "10 loops, best of 3: 64.1 ms per loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, optimized median filtering is2x faster than the unoptimized version. If you check its source, you can see that median filtering is SIMD optimized. So you can use this to enable optimization at the top of your code (remember it is enabled by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Performance in IPython\n",
    "Sometimes you may need to compare the performance of two similar operations. IPython gives you a magic command timeit to perform this. It runs the code several times to get more accurate results. Once again, it is suitable to measuring single lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, do you know which of the following addition operations is better, x = 5; y = x**2, x = 5; y = x*x, x = np.uint8([5]); y = x*x, or y = np.square(x)? We will find out with timeit in the IPython shell.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [10]: x = 5\n",
    "In [11]: %timeit y=x**2\n",
    "10000000 loops, best of 3: 73 ns per loop\n",
    "In [12]: %timeit y=x*x\n",
    "10000000 loops, best of 3: 58.3 ns per loop\n",
    "In [15]: z = np.uint8([5])\n",
    "In [17]: %timeit y=z*z\n",
    "1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.25 us per loop\n",
    "In [19]: %timeit y=np.square(z)\n",
    "1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.16 us per loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can see that, x = 5 ; y = x*x is fastest and it is around 20x faster compared to Numpy. If you consider the array creation also, it may reach up to 100x faster. Cool, right? *(Numpy devs are working on this issue)*\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "Python scalar operations are faster than Numpy scalar operations. So for operations including one or two elements, Python scalar is better than Numpy arrays. Numpy has the advantage when the size of the array is a little bit bigger.\n",

    "We will try one more example. This time, we will compare the performance of [**cv.countNonZero()**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/de0/group__core__utils.html#ga3c8487ea4449e550bc39575ede094c7a) and **np.count_nonzero()** for the same image.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [35]: %timeit z = cv.countNonZero(img)\n",
    "100000 loops, best of 3: 15.8 us per loop\n",
    "In [36]: %timeit z = np.count_nonzero(img)\n",
    "1000 loops, best of 3: 370 us per loop\n",

    "See, the OpenCV function is nearly 25x faster than the Numpy function.\n",

    "> **Note**\n",
    "Normally, OpenCV functions are faster than Numpy functions. So for same operation, OpenCV functions are preferred. But, there can be exceptions, especially when Numpy works with views instead of copies.\n",

    "### More IPython magic commands\n",
    "There are several other magic commands to measure performance, profiling, line profiling, memory measurement, and etc. They all are well documented. So only links to those docs are provided here. Interested readers are recommended to try them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimization Techniques\n",
    "There are several techniques and coding methods to exploit maximum performance of Python and Numpy. Only relevant ones are noted here and links are given to important sources. The main thing to be noted here is, first try to implement the algorithm in a simple manner. Once it is working, profile it, find the bottlenecks, and optimize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Avoid using loops in Python as much as possible, especially double/triple loops etc. They are inherently slow.\n",
    "2. Vectorize the algorithm/code to the maximum extent possible, because Numpy and OpenCV are optimized for vector operations.\n",
    "3. Exploit the cache coherence.\n",
    "4. Never make copies of an array unless it is necessary. Try to use views instead. Array copying is a costly operation.\n",
    "If your code is still slow after doing all of these operations, or if the use of large loops is inevitable, use additional libraries like Cython to make it faster.\n",
